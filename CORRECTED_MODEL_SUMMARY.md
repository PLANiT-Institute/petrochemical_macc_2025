# Corrected MACC Model Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified

The original MACC model had fundamental scale unit inconsistencies:

1. **Mixed capacity vs throughput units** in technology definitions
2. **CAPEX costs incorrectly applied** to deployment variables representing unclear concepts
3. **Abatement calculations using wrong unit basis**
4. **No clear separation** between capacity installation and production decisions

## Solution Implemented

### Core Principle: Separate Capacity and Production

The corrected model implements three distinct decision variables:

```python
# NEW CORRECTED VARIABLES
m.install_capacity = Var(m.TECHS, m.YEARS, within=NonNegativeReals)  # kt/year new capacity installed
m.total_capacity = Var(m.TECHS, m.YEARS, within=NonNegativeReals)    # kt/year total available capacity  
m.production = Var(m.TECHS, m.YEARS, within=NonNegativeReals)        # kt/year actual production
```

### Unit Consistency Framework

| Component | Unit | Application |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **CAPEX** | Million USD per kt/year capacity | Applied to `install_capacity` decisions |
| **OPEX** | USD per tonne production | Applied to `production` throughput |
| **Abatement** | tCO2 per tonne production | Applied to `production * 1000` (kt→t conversion) |
| **Capacity** | kt/year processing capacity | Physical installation limit |
| **Production** | kt/year actual throughput | Operational output |

### Key Constraints

1. **Capacity Evolution** (vintaging with lifetime):
   ```python
   capacity[tech, year] = sum(install[tech, tau] for tau in active_years[tech, year])
   ```

2. **Production Limits**:
   ```python
   production[tech, year] <= capacity[tech, year]
   ```

3. **Proper Cost Calculation**:
   ```python
   # Annualized CAPEX based on capacity installation
   annual_capex = install_capacity[tech, year] * capex_per_kt[tech, year] * CRF[tech]
   
   # Annual OPEX based on actual production
   annual_opex = production[tech, year] * opex_per_t[tech, year] / 1000
   ```

4. **Correct Abatement Calculation**:
   ```python
   abatement[tech, year] = production[tech, year] * abatement_per_t[tech, year] * 1000
   ```

## Benefits of Corrected Approach

1. **Clear Unit Consistency**: All costs, capacities, and production in consistent units
2. **Realistic Technology Implementation**: Separates investment from operational decisions  
3. **Proper Scale Representation**: Technology deployment reflects actual industrial implementation
4. **Accurate Costing**: CAPEX for capacity, OPEX for production
5. **Better Constraints**: Mass balance and capacity limits properly enforced
6. **Vintage Tracking**: Proper equipment lifetime and replacement modeling

## Next Steps

The corrected model formulation is complete and validated. To integrate with the full application:

1. Update main CLI to use `CorrectedMACCModelBuilder` instead of original
2. Update data loading to populate corrected parameter structure  
3. Update results analysis to handle separated capacity/production variables
4. Add visualization for capacity vs production evolution over time

## Technical Impact

This correction transforms the MACC model from a conceptual optimization into a realistic industrial capacity planning tool that properly represents:

- **Investment timing decisions** (when to build capacity)
- **Operational decisions** (how to use installed capacity)  
- **Technology vintaging** (equipment lifetime and replacement)
- **Scale economics** (proper relationship between fixed and variable costs)
- **Industrial constraints** (realistic ramp rates and market penetration)
