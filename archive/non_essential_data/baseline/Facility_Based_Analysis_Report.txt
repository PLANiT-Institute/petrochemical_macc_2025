KOREAN PETROCHEMICAL MACC MODEL - FACILITY-BASED RESTRUCTURING ANALYSIS
=======================================================================
Analysis Date: 2025-08-28 00:52:58

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
-----------------
• Model successfully restructured from technology-band to facility-based approach
• Total industry capacity: 17,300 kt/year
• Total industry emissions: 14,756.4 ktCO2/year
• Target alignment: -70.5% vs 50 MtCO2 industry baseline
• Data quality: GOOD

STRUCTURAL CHANGES IMPLEMENTED:
------------------------------
1. ✅ Replaced technology-band structure with facility-based modeling
2. ✅ Aligned BaselineConsumption with RegionalFacilities data  
3. ✅ Updated company information with correct names and locations
4. ✅ Added new companies: 여천NCC, 한화 토탈, 현대케미칼, 대한유화
5. ✅ Validated total emissions against 50 MtCO2 industry benchmark

FACILITY STRUCTURE:
------------------
• Total Facilities: 8
• Yeosu Region: 4 facilities (['LG Chem', 'GS Caltex', 'Lotte Chemical', '여천NCC'])
• Daesan Region: 2 facilities (['한화 토탈', '현대케미칼'])  
• Ulsan Region: 2 facilities (['SK Chemicals', '대한유화'])

CAPACITY DISTRIBUTION:
--------------------
• NCC (Naphtha Cracking): 10,300 kt/year
• BTX (Aromatics): 5,200 kt/year  
• C4 (Olefins): 1,800 kt/year

REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION:
--------------------
• Daesan: 3,050.0 kt/year (17.6%)
• Ulsan: 2,800.0 kt/year (16.2%)
• Yeosu: 11,450.0 kt/year (66.2%)

VALIDATION ISSUES (2):
------------------------------
1. Emission intensity below industry benchmark (2.5-4.0 tCO2/t)
2. Yeosu share (66.2%) outside expected range (45-65%)

RECOMMENDATIONS (1):
------------------------------
1. Review emission factors and consumption profiles - may be underestimated

NEXT STEPS:
----------
1. Update Excel database with new facility-based structure
2. Modify simulation and optimization models to use facility-level data
3. Update alternative technology mapping to facility level
4. Validate model results against industry benchmarks
5. Integrate with time-series data for dynamic modeling
